Regression test for the JIT crashing when compiling a method with invalid
dead dex code. For not compilable methods we don't gather samples and we don't
trigger JIT compilation. However kAccDontBotherCompile is not persisted in the
oat file and so we may end up compiling a method which we shouldn't.
